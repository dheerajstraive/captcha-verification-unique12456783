# Simple CAPTCHA Verification and Refresh Webpage

Welcome to the Simple CAPTCHA Verification and Refresh Webpage project! This project is a minimal implementation of a CAPTCHA system on a single webpage. It allows users to view a CAPTCHA, input the displayed code, and verify if their input matches the CAPTCHA. Users can also refresh to get a new CAPTCHA code if needed.

## Project Overview

The project consists of a single HTML file (`index.html`) that includes all the necessary components for a basic CAPTCHA system. The page is self-contained and does not require a server-side backend or database.

## Features

- **CAPTCHA Generation**: Automatically generates a CAPTCHA code when the page loads.
- **Verification**: Allows user input and checks if it matches the generated CAPTCHA code.
- **Refreshing CAPTCHA**: Users can refresh the CAPTCHA code to generate a new challenge.
- **User Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback on whether the CAPTCHA input was correct or incorrect.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Download the Project**: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-captcha-webpage.git
   ```

2. **Open the HTML File**: Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your preferred web browser. No web server is necessary, as the page is entirely static.

3. **Interacting with the CAPTCHA**:
    - When the page loads, a CAPTCHA image and an input box will be displayed.
    - Enter the characters you see in the CAPTCHA image into the input box.
    - Click the "Verify" button to check if your input is correct.
    - Click the "Refresh" button to generate a new CAPTCHA if needed.

## Technical Details

- **HTML and JavaScript**: The project primarily uses HTML for structure and inline JavaScript for CAPTCHA logic.
- **No External Libraries**: This implementation does not rely on external libraries or frameworks, making it lightweight and simple to use.
