# Simple CAPTCHA Verification and Refresh Webpage

Welcome to the Simple CAPTCHA Verification and Refresh Webpage project. This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a CAPTCHA verification system with a refresh feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The CAPTCHA is used to differentiate between human users and bots, enhancing the security of forms and other web applications.

## Overview

This project consists of a very simple webpage that displays a CAPTCHA image and provides an input field for users to enter the CAPTCHA text. A refresh button allows users to generate a new CAPTCHA if the current one is unclear. This is a basic implementation intended for demonstration and educational purposes.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-captcha-webpage.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd simple-captcha-webpage
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser:**

   You can simply double-click the file in your file explorer, or open it using a browser of your choice.

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the webpage and the CAPTCHA form.
- `styles.css`: Provides the styling for the webpage, enhancing its visual appeal.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic to generate the CAPTCHA, handle form submissions, and refresh the CAPTCHA.

## Features

- **CAPTCHA Display**: A randomly generated CAPTCHA image is displayed on the webpage.
- **User Input**: An input field is provided for user input.
- **Verification**: Basic verification of the CAPTCHA input against the generated CAPTCHA.
- **Refresh Functionality**: A button to refresh and generate a new CAPTCHA if needed.

## How It Works

1. **CAPTCHA Generation**: On page load, a CAPTCHA consisting of random alphanumeric characters is generated.
2. **User Input**: Users enter the characters they see in the CAPTCHA into the input field provided.
3. **Verification**: When the user submits the form, the input is checked against the generated CAPTCHA. Feedback is provided based on the result.
4. **Refresh**: Clicking the refresh button generates a new CAPTCHA.

## Customization

To customize the project:

- **Change CAPTCHA Complexity**: Modify the CAPTCHA generation logic in `script.js` to increase the complexity or length of the CAPTCHA.
- **Style Adjustments**: Edit `styles.css` to change the design, layout, or color scheme of the webpage to better match your preference or branding.
